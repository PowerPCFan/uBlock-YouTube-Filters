# uBlock Origin YouTube Filters
## How to import/enable
1. Go to the extension page. This can be done by clicking on the uBO extension icon and clicking the settings cog icon.
2. Go to the "My Filters" tab.
3. Press the button that says "Allow custom filters requiring trust" - this allows some of the filters to work properly
4. Download [the filter list](https://github.com/PowerPCFan/uBlock-YouTube-Filters/blob/main/uBlock-YouTube-Filters.txt) and import it using the "import and append" button at the top.
5. You're done! 

Seems to work well on Firefox, your results may vary on other browsers - this is by no means a perfect filter list, but it should improve the YouTube experience!
